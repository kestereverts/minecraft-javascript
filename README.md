### Building minecraft-javascript ###
If you are using Eclipse, you can import the project into your workbench.
You may want to import the Rhino library from js-14.jar (in the _dependencies_ folder) too so you don't need it inside your Minecraft server directory.
To create the .jar file you can use the 'Export' utility.
